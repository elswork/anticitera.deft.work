## Digital Sovereignty is not requested; it is built on standards.



We are at a historical turning point. Internet infrastructure is not neutral; it is a geopolitical battlefield. While global powers secure their digital assets, Europe risks losing control over the most critical identifier of the coming decades: the **.ia** suffix.

### The Problem: Capture of the .IA Identifier
Currently, the **"IA"** code is not assigned in the official ISO 3166-1 list. This makes it "virgin digital territory." If we do not act, this code will be captured by private interests or jurisdictions outside the EU rights framework (as happened with .ai, under Anguilla's control).

### The Solution: An Unprecedented Legal Maneuver
The **Antikythera Project** proposes a bold but technically viable strategy: use the **European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)** mechanism to request the Commission to negotiate with the ISO for the assignment of the "IA" code to the region of Antikythera (Greece) under the status of **"Exceptional Reservation"**.

This is not symbolic. It is legal engineering to bring the governance of the Artificial Intelligence domain under the umbrella of the GDPR and European values.

## We Are Looking For You: Engineer, Jurist, Strategist.

To register this initiative with the European Commission, we must meet a strict bureaucratic requirement: form a **Citizens' Committee** composed of 7 persons residing in 7 different Member States.

We already have the infrastructure. We already have the legal strategy. We are missing **6 co-organizers**.

**We do not seek funding.** We seek technical legitimacy and civic commitment.

### Co-organizer Profile (Archon)
*   **Citizenship:** Passport from an EU Member State (other than Spain, which is already represented).
*   **Profile:** Telecommunications Engineering, Digital Law, Cybersecurity, AI Research...
*   **Role:** Validate the initiative before the Commission (secure online procedure) and supervise the project's ethics.

### Why Join?
Because the history of technology is written by defining standards. Being a co-organizer of this ECI means putting your name on the founding document that secured the digital identity of European AI.

## Access to the Strategic Forum (Restricted)

We have enabled a technical debate space to coordinate registration and discuss the standardization strategy with ELOT/CEN.

*(Note: Requires registration in the EU system. If you fit the profile we are looking for, you already know how it works).*
