When I started the journey of Antikythera and the promotion of the **.ia** domain, I was inspired by the history of the Antikythera mechanism and its symbolism as the remote origin of artificial intelligence. However, I must admit a mistake: in my first texts, I forgot to give **Latin America** the place it deserves, a region that not only has much to contribute, but must be at the center of this project.

That omission is not minor. Because talking about the digital future, artificial intelligence, and new ways of inhabiting the internet without mentioning Latin America is to leave out millions of voices, talents, and communities that are transforming technology every day.

Latin America is creativity in its purest form. Its cities are brimming with technological ventures, its universities conduct rigorous research, and its young people—connected, critical, and dreamers—are protagonists of the digital revolution. From Brazilian fintechs to innovation hubs in Mexico, Chile, Argentina, or Colombia, the region not only keeps pace with the world: **it sets trends and creates solutions with its own stamp**.

But there is something deeper. LATAM brings a unique perspective: a way of understanding life, community, and the future where technology is not just a tool, but a human bridge. That perspective is essential if we want artificial intelligence and the .ia domain to be truly inclusive, diverse, and responsible.

The Antikythera project was born as a tribute to history, but it must grow as a **global and shared** space. And in that growth, Latin America will not be a guest: it will be a co-protagonist. Because the future of artificial intelligence and the network we build together cannot be written without the Latin American pulse.

Today I want to amend the mistake of not having said it before and, at the same time, open the door wide: **Latin America is and will be an essential part of Antikythera and the .ia domain**.

This is a journey that honors the past on the Greek island that gives it its name, but that looks to the future with the transformative force of all of us who believe that artificial intelligence can and should be a tool for the common good. And in that future, **Latin America is at the heart of the project**.
