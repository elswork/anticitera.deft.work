# **The Antikythera Project: Uniting Ancient Engineering and the Future of Artificial Intelligence**

The Antikythera project is presented as an innovative initiative with the central objective of establishing a new Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) ".IA" associated with the territory of the island of Antikythera <sup>1</sup>. This enterprise is inspired by the Antikythera mechanism, considered the first analog computer in history, standing as a symbol of the dawn of artificial intelligence and technological innovation <sup>1</sup>. The significance of this ancient artifact, discovered in the deep sea near the Greek island, lies in its sophistication and ability to calculate astronomical phenomena, which challenges our understanding of the technological capabilities of the ancient world <sup>2</sup>. The Antikythera project seeks to capitalize on this rich heritage, proposing that the island, the cradle of this mechanical prodigy, be recognized in the digital space through a domain that evokes the origins of computing and intelligence <sup>1</sup>.

Beyond the mere creation of a distinctive web address, the Antikythera initiative aims to foster a global community of artificial intelligence enthusiasts around this new domain <sup>1</sup>. It is recognized that the success of a new ccTLD intrinsically depends on its adoption and the vitality of the ecosystem that develops around it. Therefore, the project focuses on building a network of individuals and organizations that share an interest in artificial intelligence and see in the ".IA" domain a representative and significant space <sup>1</sup>. This vision of community underscores the understanding that innovation in the field of artificial intelligence is a collective effort that transcends geographical and linguistic boundaries.

A fundamental aspect of the Antikythera project's proposal is the intention to establish a domain that can be used by most of the world's languages <sup>1</sup>. This ambition contrasts directly with the ".AI" domain, which, although it has become a de facto standard for projects related to artificial intelligence, is intrinsically linked to the English term ("Artificial Intelligence") and is, in fact, the ccTLD of the British overseas territory of Anguilla <sup>1</sup>. By proposing ".IA", which evokes "Inteligencia Artificial" in Spanish and Portuguese, among other languages, the project seeks to create a more inclusive and representative online space for the global artificial intelligence community <sup>1</sup>.

To support this initiative, the Antikythera project has developed the Antikythera Assistant by OpenAI <sup>1</sup>. This tool is presented as a valuable resource for the creation of technological projects linked to the ".IA" domain, demonstrating a proactive approach to fostering the utility and adoption of the new domain <sup>1</sup>. The existence of this assistant, together with the vision of building an active community, suggests that the project is not limited to the application for a domain, but actively seeks to build a support infrastructure for its use and growth. This report will analyze in detail the various aspects of the Antikythera project, from its historical inspiration to its present objectives and its potential future impact.

## **Unveiling the Vision: Purpose and Objectives of the .IA Domain Initiative**

The primary purpose of the Antikythera project is the creation of ".IA" as a new Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) specifically for the island of Antikythera <sup>1</sup>. This initiative is based on the recognition of the deep historical significance of the island in relation to the origins of artificial intelligence and technological innovation <sup>1</sup>. The choice of Antikythera is not accidental; the island is famous for the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism, an artifact more than two thousand years old that is considered the first analog computer of humanity <sup>14</sup>. This historical and symbolic link is the pillar on which the proposal of the ".IA" domain is built, seeking to establish a connection between the computational engineering of the past and the development of artificial intelligence in the present and the future <sup>1</sup>. The initiative seeks that this ccTLD not be just an address on the internet, but a symbol of the enduring human capacity for innovation in the field of computing.

A key objective of the project is the formation of a global community of artificial intelligence enthusiasts who actively support the creation and adoption of this ccTLD <sup>1</sup>. The project recognizes that the viability and success of a new domain depend to a large extent on the support and participation of the community it aims to serve. By fostering the creation of a network of researchers, developers, and artificial intelligence enthusiasts, the Antikythera project seeks to ensure that the ".IA" domain becomes a dynamic and relevant space for collaboration and knowledge exchange <sup>1</sup>. This focus on community building reflects an understanding that artificial intelligence is a constantly evolving field that benefits from a diversity of perspectives and collaboration on a global level.

One of the central motivations behind the proposal of the ".IA" domain is the intention to create a domain name that can be used by most of the world's languages <sup>1</sup>. Currently, the ".AI" domain, which belongs to Anguilla <sup>18</sup>, is widely used for artificial intelligence projects, despite being intrinsically linked to the English term <sup>1</sup>. The Antikythera project argues that this situation gives disproportionate weight to the English language in a field that benefits enormously from linguistic and cultural diversity <sup>12</sup>. By proposing ".IA", which has a direct resonance with "Inteligencia Artificial" in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and French, among other languages <sup>16</sup>, the project seeks to establish a more equitable and inclusive online space for the global artificial intelligence community <sup>1</sup>. This initiative represents an attempt to challenge the hegemony of English in science and technology, promoting an online environment where diverse languages and cultures can contribute and be represented in the field of artificial intelligence <sup>12</sup>.

As a concrete step towards realizing its vision, the Antikythera project has developed the Antikythera Assistant by OpenAI <sup>1</sup>. This artificial intelligence tool is specifically designed to assist in the creation of technological projects related to the ".IA" domain <sup>1</sup>. The existence of this assistant not only provides a practical resource for future users of the ".IA" domain, but also underscores the project's commitment to innovation and the fostering of an active community around its proposal <sup>1</sup>. By offering a tool that facilitates the development of projects within the ".IA" ecosystem, the Antikythera project seeks to incentivize the adoption of the new domain and build an online environment where artificial intelligence can flourish in a multilingual and culturally rich context.

## **Deconstructing the Digital Presence: Website Analysis (UI/UX, Features, and Functionalities)**

The .IA Antikythera Island project website ([https://Anticitera.deft.work](https://anticitera.deft.work)) presents a clean and direct design on its homepage <sup>1</sup>. The main navigation is clearly visible at the top, offering access to the "Home", "Blog", "Project", "Links", "Podcasts", and "X" sections <sup>1</sup>. The inclusion of a "Skip to main content" link is a positive practice that improves accessibility for users who use screen readers <sup>1</sup>. Immediately below the main introduction, the three latest blog posts are displayed, facilitating the discovery of recent content <sup>1</sup>. However, a search functionality is not immediately apparent, which could slightly hinder usability for users looking for specific information quickly <sup>1</sup>. In the footer, there are icons that link to social media, which contributes to the visual appeal and facilitates the recognition of these links <sup>1</sup>.

The blog section of the Antikythera project presents a list of posts ordered chronologically in reverse, showing the most recent ones first <sup>20</sup>. Each entry includes the title of the post and the month and year of its publication <sup>20</sup>. The usability of this section is simple, as the list format allows for easy scanning of available articles. The titles are clear, which helps users quickly understand the topic of each post, and the dates provided allow for the identification of recent content <sup>20</sup>. The visual appeal of the blog section is minimalist, consisting of a simple list of links <sup>20</sup>. While it is clean and functional, it lacks visual elements that could make it more attractive. The inclusion of ".IA Isla Anticitera Â© 2025" at the bottom provides a clear indication of the blog's origin and the current year <sup>20</sup>. However, areas for potential improvement are identified, such as the addition of thumbnail images or excerpts for each post, which could improve the visual appeal and provide more context to users before clicking on a title. The implementation of a system of categories or tags would allow users to filter and find relevant content according to their specific interests within the general theme of the .IA Antikythera Island project. The inclusion of a search functionality within the blog section would significantly improve usability for users looking for specific information. While the month and year are provided, including the day of publication could be beneficial for users who need more precise information about the currency of a post. Finally, the use of headings or other visual cues to better separate blog posts could improve readability <sup>20</sup>.

The user interface of the links section of the Antikythera project seems functional, but the information provided is not sufficient for a thorough evaluation of its usability and accessibility <sup>21</sup>. This section is accessed through a clear "Links" tab in the top navigation menu <sup>21</sup>. The links are presented as embedded YouTube videos and article previews with titles, which provides a quick overview of the content <sup>21</sup>. Users can directly access the linked content by clicking on the previews or the provided YouTube links <sup>21</sup>. However, no information is available on the existence of a search or filtering functionality for the links, nor on whether the links are categorized or organized in any specific way, nor if additional descriptions are provided for each link that offer more context <sup>21</sup>. Regarding accessibility, the information is limited. While the use of text for the titles is positive, it is not clear if the preview images are accompanied by descriptive alternative text for screen readers, if all links and functionalities can be accessed via the keyboard, if there is sufficient color contrast between the text and the background for users with low vision, or if the embedded YouTube videos have adequate subtitles for deaf or hard of hearing users <sup>21</sup>. The design of the section seems relatively clean, with a clear separation between the links, and the use of thumbnails and previews provides visual cues about the content of each link, seeming consistent with the overall theme of the website <sup>21</sup>. However, the visual appeal could be improved with a greater variety in presentation styles, as the repetitive format of YouTube embeds and article previews could... [truncated]

According to the navigation menu, there are other sections on the website, such as "Project", "Podcasts", and "X" <sup>1</sup>. However, during the investigation, the pages corresponding to "Project" and "Podcasts" were inaccessible <sup>22</sup>. The "X" section presumably links to the project's account on the Twitter platform (now X) <sup>1</sup>. The inaccessibility of the "Project" and "Podcasts" sections represents a significant limitation to fully understanding the initiative, as the "Project" section would likely contain detailed information about the objectives, methodology, and team behind the project, while the "Podcasts" section could offer relevant audio content <sup>22</sup>.

In general, the evaluation of the user interface and user experience of the Antikythera website is limited by the information available in the provided snippets, which focus mainly on specific sections <sup>1</sup>. A complete assessment would require access to all sections of the website and a more detailed analysis of its architecture, responsiveness, and compliance with web design principles.

## **The Technological Foundation: Understanding the Creation of a New ccTLD**

The fundamental technology behind the Antikythera project, beyond the website's infrastructure, lies in the process of establishing a new Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) <sup>1</sup>. The creation and management of ccTLDs are overseen by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) <sup>18</sup>. IANA, which is part of ICANN, is responsible for coordinating the global unique identifiers of the internet <sup>18</sup>. The process for granting a ccTLD to a geographical region requires a detailed application to ICANN, demonstrating how the desired domain aligns with the identity of the country or territory and justifying its need <sup>25</sup>. ICANN and IANA evaluate this application using specific eligibility criteria, considering key factors such as the unique national or territorial identity of the region, a genuine need for the domain, and the region's ability to manage and maintain it efficiently <sup>25</sup>. Once the application is approved, ICANN and IANA work closely with the designated authority of the requesting region to finalize the terms and responsibilities, subsequently integrating the ccTLD into the global domain name system <sup>25</sup>.

The creation of a new ccTLD is a complex regulatory process that involves international organizations such as IANA and ICANN <sup>18</sup>. The participation of these entities underscores the magnitude of the organizational and potentially political effort that the Antikythera project requires. For the ".IA" domain application to be successful, the project will need to build a solid argument that demonstrates the unique historical and symbolic identity of the island in relation to technological innovation, as well as the need for a multilingual domain for artificial intelligence <sup>25</sup>. In addition, it will be crucial to present a credible plan for the efficient technical and administrative management of the domain <sup>25</sup>.

The general steps to obtain a ccTLD involve submitting a detailed application to ICANN, demonstrating alignment with the territory's identity and a genuine need, as well as the ability to manage and maintain the domain efficiently <sup>25</sup>. The eligibility criteria considered by ICANN and IANA include the unique identity of the region, a real need for the domain, and the capacity for efficient management <sup>25</sup>. It is important to note that the process for new generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) is different and more complex than for ccTLDs <sup>26</sup>. ccTLDs are usually managed by national or territorial organizations (ccTLD registries) responsible for maintaining domain names and establishing registration criteria <sup>25</sup>. These registries establish the requirements for registration, which can vary considerably from one registry to another, and may include residency or local presence requirements <sup>25</sup>. If the ".IA" domain is approved, the Antikythera project will need to establish a designated authority or registry to manage the domain and define the rules for registration, which will be a crucial aspect for the long-term sustainability of the project. The decision to impose specific requirements for registering a ".IA" domain, such as a connection to the island or a focus on activities related to artificial intelligence, will impact the adoption of the domain and the type of community that forms around it.

While not directly applicable to ".IA", there is an Accelerated Process for ccTLDs with IDNs (Internationalized Domain Names) for countries that use non-Latin scripts <sup>24</sup>, which demonstrates ICANN's flexibility to adapt to diverse linguistic needs. Finally, the concept of pseudo-ccTLDs, which mimic official domains without formal recognition <sup>24</sup>, underscores the importance of the Antikythera project's ambition to obtain official recognition for the ".IA" domain.

## **The Human Element: Exploring the Team and Community Behind Antikythera**

The information available on the project's website about the team or organization behind the initiative is limited <sup>1</sup>. While a "community of people" involved in the project is mentioned <sup>1</sup>, there is no dedicated section that describes the team or organization in detail. However, the project's GitHub repository (<https://github.com/elswork/anticitera.deft.work>) is presented as a potential source of information about the collaborators and the development of the project <sup>19</sup>. The existence of this repository on an open-source collaboration platform suggests a community-based and participatory approach to the initiative, which implies that the project is driven more by a collective effort than by a traditional hierarchical organizational structure.

The GitHub repository contains a variety of relevant information, including the project's objectives, which focus on promoting the creation and adoption of the .IA ccTLD, highlighting the historical and cultural importance of the Antikythera mechanism, and fostering collaboration <sup>19</sup>. It also details the ways in which people can contribute to the project, such as participating in a mailing list, strategic collaboration, and dissemination and promotion through social media such as Facebook, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp <sup>19</sup>. In addition, the repository includes important links to the Antikythera Assistant by OpenAI, a reservation form for .IA domains, the official reservation list, a table of people and organizations involved, proposals for the creation of the .IA ccTLD on Change.org and the European Citizens' Initiative Forum, and a subscription link to the mailing list <sup>19</sup>. The structure of the repository reveals a logical organization of the project, with directories for "Posts" (blog articles), "_site" (website configuration), and "Origin" (links detailing the history and relevance of the island of Antikythera and its relationship with artificial intelligence) <sup>19</sup>. Links to articles and interviews that discuss the project from various perspectives are also provided, as well as information about the repository's license (MIT), related topics (artificial intelligence, cctld, gpts, openai-chatgpt, antikythera-island), and a link to the README file <sup>19</sup>. The presence of an open issue in the repository suggests that the project is in an active phase of development and discussion <sup>19</sup>.

The inclusion of proposals for the creation of the .IA ccTLD on platforms such as Change.org and the European Citizens' Initiative Forum indicates an effort by the project to obtain broader public and political support for its initiative <sup>19</sup>. The use of these platforms demonstrates an understanding of the need to mobilize public opinion and potentially influence political decisions related to the creation of new ccTLDs.

## **External Voices: A Review of Public Perception and Academic Discourse**

The Antikythera mechanism is widely recognized as the oldest known analog computer and a marvel of ancient technology <sup>2</sup>. Its complexity, purpose, and origins continue to be the subject of research and fascination <sup>5</sup>. Various interpretations of its function have emerged, ranging from astronomical calculations to educational and philosophical purposes <sup>5</sup>. The established historical and scientific significance of the Antikythera mechanism provides a solid and easily understandable basis for the narrative of the Antikythera project, immediately associating the proposed domain with innovation and intelligence. The public is already curious about this ancient artifact, which creates a natural connection with the concept of artificial intelligence, making the name and central idea of the project instantly more attractive and memorable.

There are arguments in favor of the creation of the .IA domain, such as breaking the hegemony of English in AI, fostering a global community, and honoring the historical importance of Antikythera <sup>12</sup>. In online forums such as Reddit, interest in the .IA domain has been expressed by Spanish and Portuguese speakers, as ".IA" corresponds to "Inteligencia Artificial" in these languages <sup>16</sup>. However, in online discussions it has also been pointed out that ".ia" is already the top-level domain for Imagua and the Assimas, a fictional nation in the game NationStates <sup>16</sup>. It is important to clarify that this use does not correspond to a ccTLD officially recognized by IANA <sup>18</sup>. The existence of an unofficial ".ia" associated with a fictional entity poses a possible challenge for the Antikythera project in establishing its legitimacy and uniqueness. Clear communication about its pursuit of official recognition by IANA will be crucial. The project has implemented calls to action to support the .IA domain initiative, including reserving domains and participating in social media and relevant platforms <sup>17</sup>. In promotional materials, hashtags such as #IA, #Antikythera, and #InteligenciaArtificial are used <sup>15</sup>.

| --- | --- | --- |

The general principles and best practices for choosing domain names include memorability, brand alignment, and SEO considerations <sup>35</sup>. AI-powered domain name generation tools play a role in brainstorming and finding available domains <sup>35</sup>. The Antikythera project seeks to leverage the inherent semantic relevance of ".IA" for "Artificial Intelligence" in several languages, which aligns with the principles of choosing a good domain name. The historical connection with Antikythera further reinforces its brandability and uniqueness.

## **Looking Ahead: Long-Term Goals and Potential Development Trajectory**

The long-term vision of the Antikythera project focuses on breaking the hegemony of English in the field of artificial intelligence and fostering a global and multilingual community <sup>12</sup>. It is expected that the ".IA" domain will become a recognized and respected identifier for projects, research, and organizations related to artificial intelligence worldwide. There is the potential for the island of Antikythera to become a symbolic center for international collaboration in the field of artificial intelligence, leveraging its historical significance <sup>12</sup>. This ambition goes beyond a simple domain name, seeking to position the island as a focal point for global discourse and collaboration in artificial intelligence, based on its unique historical connection with computing. This could attract researchers, developers, and policymakers, which could lead to greater recognition and initiatives related to the field.

In the future, partnerships with academic institutions, research organizations, and technology companies could be explored. The Antikythera Assistant could play a crucial role in fostering innovation and adoption within the ".IA" domain.

Success in establishing the ".IA" domain could contribute to a more equitable representation of different languages and cultures within the field of artificial intelligence online. The symbolic connection with the Antikythera mechanism adds a unique historical dimension to this modern technological domain. In addition, the project could generate greater recognition and interest in the island of Antikythera itself. On a broader level, the initiative raises reflections on internet governance and the representation of diverse linguistic and cultural identities online.

## **Conclusion: Synthesizing Findings and Offering Strategic Perspectives**

The Antikythera project represents an ambitious and forward-thinking initiative that seeks to establish a new ccTLD ".IA" for the island of Antikythera, inspired by the historic Antikythera mechanism as a symbol of the origins of artificial intelligence. The project aims to foster a global and multilingual community around this domain, challenging the hegemony of English in the field of artificial intelligence.

Among the project's strengths are its solid historical and symbolic basis, the clear vision of promoting linguistic inclusivity, and the creation of an active community. The existence of the Antikythera Assistant by OpenAI is a concrete step to support the adoption of the domain. However, the project also faces potential challenges, such as the need to obtain approval from IANA and ICANN for the new ccTLD and the existence of the unofficial use of ".ia" for a fictional nation.

The following strategic perspectives are offered:

- **Website Improvement:** It is essential to prioritize the accessibility of all sections of the website, especially "Project" and "Podcasts". In addition, it is recommended to improve the UI/UX of the blog and links sections by implementing the suggestions detailed above (thumbnails, categories, search, etc.).
- **Community Engagement:** Community participation should continue to be encouraged through the GitHub repository and other platforms. It is important to clearly communicate the project's progress and the ways in which people can contribute.
- **.IA Domain Promotion Efforts:** In promotional efforts, it is crucial to clearly distinguish the proposal of the official ".IA" ccTLD from the existing unofficial use. The pursuit of official recognition by IANA and the unique benefits of the proposed domain in terms of linguistic relevance and historical connection should be emphasized.

In conclusion, the Antikythera project has significant potential to impact the landscape of artificial intelligence online, promoting greater linguistic and cultural diversity and honoring the rich history of computational innovation. Its success will depend on the team's ability to overcome regulatory challenges and build a global community committed to its vision.
