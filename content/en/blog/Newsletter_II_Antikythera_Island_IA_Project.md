## Project Updates

These are the project news since the last newsletter in March.

### What achievements can we highlight in this time?

- We have reached 100 signatures on [the Change.org Petition](https://chng.it/hqCyzBpwgW).
- We have tried to reach relevant personalities and companies, but so far we have not been successful, but we will not give up, we will try again by all available means.
- We have created the Telegram channel [Archimedes' Hacker Disciple](https://t.me/+oAeZGMsePDg2ZDI0) to have a more direct connection with you.

## Events and Activities

It is worth highlighting the interview conducted with Pablo Gutierrez on the program De Hacker a Hacker.
