## Introduction and Welcome

This is the first Newsletter about the .IA Antikythera Island Project.

### What is the .IA Antikythera Island Project?

The .IA Antikythera Island Project is an initiative that seeks to create a new Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) .IA associated with the territory of the Island of Antikythera. This small island, famous for the Antikythera Mechanism, considered the first analog computer in history, becomes a symbol of the origins of Artificial Intelligence and technological innovation.
The .IA Antikythera Island Project is also the community of people who in one way or another are part of the project, this is the most valuable asset of the project, the one that will help the project achieve its objectives.

## Project Updates

This project was born in 2019 from an idea that in 2023 was embodied in a collaborative portal.

### What achievements can we highlight in this time?

We have reached several users through the portal and the published articles, we have 85 signatures on [the Change.org Petition](https://chng.it/hqCyzBpwgW).
The greatest achievement in this time was on the [MyPublicInbox.com](https://mypublicinbox.com/) platform through which we established contact with [Chema Alonso](https://mypublicinbox.com/ChemaAlonso), who gave us the opportunity to publish two articles on his blog and suggested the media plan to publicize our project. Below is the list of articles and interviews resulting from the media plan:
