## Joining Forces and Gaining Momentum

Hello everyone,

With great enthusiasm I present to you the fourth newsletter of the .IA Antikythera Island Project. In recent weeks, we have witnessed how collaboration and continuous effort are bearing fruit, bringing us ever closer to our goals.

### A Special Thanks to Chema Alonso

We want to extend a very special thanks to **Chema Alonso**, who has kindly published our new video on his YouTube channel. Gestures like his are a fundamental pillar for the dissemination of our project, allowing us to reach a wider and more diverse audience. Your generosity and support inspire us to keep going.

### We Continue to Knock on Doors

Following our dissemination strategy, we have continued to contact relevant personalities in the computer science and artificial intelligence sector. Although it is a path that requires patience and perseverance, every conversation and every new connection enriches us and opens doors for future collaborations. We are convinced that the sum of talent and experience is the key to materializing the vision of Antikythera.

### The Project Under the Magnifying Glass of AI

A fascinating event in recent weeks has been to see how our own project has become an object of study by various artificial intelligences. The recent publications on our blog, where models like Gemini, DeepSeek and others analyze the foundations and objectives of the Antikythera Project, not only validate the relevance of our initiative, but also provide us with valuable feedback.

This "meta-reflection" prompts us to refine our ideas and confirms that we are on the right track towards creating an open, ethical and beneficial AI ecosystem for all.

Thank you for continuing to be part of this adventure.
