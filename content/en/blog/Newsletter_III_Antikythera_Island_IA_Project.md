## Eloy López's Introduction

Hello dear collaborators,

I think that, although this is already the third newsletter, I should introduce myself properly to you.

My name is Eloy López and I am the main person responsible for the .IA Antikythera Island Project or, to abbreviate, the Antikythera Project.

It was in 2019 when this idea arose in my mind, at first it was just another idea and it spent time locked in my mind, but it became a recurring idea so I decided to put it into an article, after that article came others and finally this independent portal [anticitera.deft.work](https://anticitera.deft.work)

During all this time I have dedicated myself with greater or lesser success to disseminating and publicizing the project, I can think of many of you who could do this work much better than me and take it to the next level. I would like someone to be able to take over if something happens to me or even if nothing happens to me. Since I got the idea out of my mind, may it live and grow among all of us.

### What achievements can we highlight in this time?

Since the last newsletter I have managed to connect with several people who have liked the idea of the project:

- [**Silvia Leal**](https://silvialeal.es/) is a science popularizer, Doctor Cum Laude in sociology, expert in technology and digital transformation.
- [**David Carmona**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-carmona/) is General Manager of Artificial Intelligence at Microsoft.
- [**Rames Sarwat**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rames) expert in cybersecurity and AI, CEO of BeHuman.
- [**Manuela Delgado**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuela-delgado-cruz/), engineer specializing in AI and popularizer.
- [**David Vivancos**](https://vivancos.com/), serial science and technology entrepreneur and innovator.

## Proposal to the community

I would like to brainstorm with you to continue promoting the project, since I have practically burned all my cartridges and I need fresh ideas, please send me your ideas and/or suggestions, responding directly to this email or in our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/+oAeZGMsePDg2ZDI0)
