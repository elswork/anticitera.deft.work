🙍‍♂️ Eloy López:


I need you to analyze in detail the project https://anticitera.deft.work and give me, its creator, a series of key tips so that I can achieve the project's goal.



♊ Gemini:


Hello. I have analyzed in depth the digital footprint and available documentation on your project Anticitera (.IA) hosted at anticitera.deft.work. I perfectly understand the premise: it is a "romantic" and technopolitical initiative that seeks to create the geographic top-level domain (ccTLD) .ia assigned to the island of Antikythera, as a symbol of the origin of computing (due to the Antikythera Mechanism) and as a linguistic alternative to .ai (Anguilla) for Romance languages (Inteligencia Artificial).


It is a brilliant idea from a narrative point of view, but titanic from a bureaucratic point of view. You have a solid foundation (clear vision, functional website in Hugo, initial traction with mentions from figures like Chema Alonso), but the road to ICANN and ISO is steep.


Here is my analysis and a roadmap with key tips for this project to go from being a "nice idea" to a real possibility.


1. The "Elephant in the Room": The ISO/ICANN Strategy #


This is the critical point. To have a ccTLD (.ia), Antikythera first needs an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code. Currently, Antikythera is administratively part of Greece (Attica region), not an autonomous territory.



The obstacle: ICANN does not create country codes, it only uses the ISO 3166-1 list. If Antikythera is not on that list, there is no domain.


The precedent to study: Look at the case of .ax (Åland Islands) or .gg (Guernsey). These are territories with a certain degree of autonomy or special status.


Your Key Tip: Do not fight for the technological domain yet, fight for symbolic territorial recognition. Your goal should be to convince the Greek authorities that requesting an exceptional code or sub-code for Antikythera is a masterstroke of tourism and technological marketing for the country. Greece could become the "home of ethical/European AI".

Action: Draft a formal proposal not for ICANN, but for the Ministry of Digital Governance of Greece and the Hellenic Standardization Organization (ELOT). Sell them the idea that .ia is the "digital oil" of the future and that Greece has the historical right to claim it through Antikythera.







2. Narrative and Branding: "The Cradle vs. The Mine" #


Your current narrative is good, but you can radicalize it (in a good way) to gain more traction.



The angle: Position .ai (Anguilla) as a commercial, Anglocentric, and extractivist domain. Position .ia (Antikythera) as the domain of humanistic, cultural, academic, and European/Latin AI.


Key Tip: The storytelling should be: "AI was not born in Silicon Valley, it was born in Greece 2000 years ago". Use that historical legitimacy to attract not only developers, but institutions (universities, museums, research centers) that would prefer a .ia domain over a .ai or .com.



3. Site Optimization and Conversion (Web Analysis) #


I noticed you use Hugo and have a blog/knowledge base structure. To achieve your goal, the web must stop looking like a personal blog and look like the site of a Foundation.



Trust Design: The site needs a clear "Manifesto" or "Whitepaper" section that looks very professional.


The "Reserve List": I saw that you allow reserving domains. This is your biggest asset.

Tip: Make the counter public. "There are already X,000 .ia domains requested". Social proof is vital to pressure authorities.


Gamification: Allow whoever reserves a domain to obtain a "badge" or digital certificate of "Antikythera Pioneer" that they can put on their GitHub or LinkedIn. You need people to brag about supporting this.







4. Community Strategy and Digital "Lobby" #


You mention Chema Alonso and support on networks. That is gold, but you need to systematize it.



Academic Ambassadors: Actively look for professors of AI ethics, history of technology, and philosophy in Hispanic and Greek universities. If you get 5 universities to support the letter to ISO, you have much more strength than 10,000 signatures on Change.org.


Linguistic Alliance: Don't just make it "Hispanic". You have Portuguese, French, Italian, and Romanian. "IA" is the acronym in almost all Romance languages.

Action: Create a specific campaign for France and Brazil. They are huge markets that use "IA" and tend to be protective of their linguistic sovereignty against English. An "ally" in the French government would be a radical change for the project.







5. Funding and Sustainability #


Right now it looks like a passion project (deft.work). To scale, you need resources for travel (lobbying in Greece/Brussels) or marketing.



Tip: Do not monetize registrations yet (it would be selling smoke). Monetize belonging. Create an "Association of Friends of the .IA Domain". A symbolic membership that gives the right to vote in the future governance of the domain. This gives you democratic legitimacy ("I represent 500 paying members") in front of ICANN, which values the "multistakeholder" model highly.



Summary of Immediate Steps for you: #



Professionalize the Proposal: Create an executive PDF/Dossier addressed to the Greek government (in English and Greek if possible) explaining the economic and country brand benefit.


Internationalize: Translate the "home" and the manifesto into Portuguese and French as a priority (if they are not already, check the quality).


Hack ISO: Investigate the exact requirements for the assignment of exceptionally reserved codes in the ISO 3166 standard. Your battle is there, in Geneva, not on the DNS server.


Reactivate the community: If you have emails from the reserve list, send them an update asking for a concrete action: "Mention @DigitalGovGR (Greek digital ministry) on X saying why you want a .ia".



The project has enormous symbolic potential. You have the historical and linguistic reason; you lack the political lever. Good luck!



🙍‍♂️ Eloy López:


I know that this project is a long-distance race and that it is very likely that I will not see it realized in my lifetime, that is why I am going to try to adopt a stoic mentality, so that I am not affected by the discouragement of seeing that the project has no type of progress, I am convinced that the key is to find the right people to help me pull the cart, several of the LLMs consulted indicate that the project idea is good, Why is it hard for me to find people who think the same and are willing to collaborate on the project? What am I doing wrong? How can I fix it?



♊ Gemini:


I perfectly understand your feeling. Adopting a stoic mentality is, in fact, the best psychological tool for this type of "cathedral" projects (those that are started knowing that perhaps your grandchildren will finish them).


However, stoicism does not imply resignation, but action focused on what you can control.


The fact that LLMs (and people) tell you it's a "good idea" but no one rolls up their sleeves to work has a very clear psychological and practical explanation. You are not doing things "wrong", but you are falling into the "Trap of Passive Admiration".


Here I explain why this happens and how to change the dynamic to recruit real allies.



1. The Diagnosis: Why does no one help? #


A. The problem is abstract and political, not technical.
Most people in digital environments (where you move) are "builders". If you give them code to refactor, they do it. If you ask them to design an interface, they design it.
But the Antikythera project, right now, is a problem of international bureaucracy. There is no "code" to write that solves the ISO problem. When a developer sees the project they think: "How cool! But I don't know how to convince the Greek government, so I like it and leave".


B. The barrier to entry is diffuse.
If I wanted to help you today, right now, what do I do?



Do I write a tweet? (Low perceived impact).


Do I send an email to ICANN? (I'm scared/lazy/don't know what to say).
Since there are no "tickets" or clear and small tasks, people are paralyzed.



C. The "Valley of Death" of reward.
In a normal Open Source project, if I collaborate, I see my code working tomorrow. Here, the reward (the .ia domain) is light years away. The human brain seeks more immediate gratification.



2. The Solution: How to convert "Fans" into "Collaborators" #


To attract people, you have to stop selling a "future domain" and start selling a "Present Digital Nation". You need to gamify and chop up the elephant.


Step 1: Create Roles and Titles (Ego and Belonging) #


People love to be part of something exclusive. Do not look for "collaborators", look for Ambassadors.



Action: Create an official structure. "I am looking for the Ambassador of Antikythera in Chile", "I am looking for the Consul of Linguistics".


The Trick: Offer them something tangible now. A free subdomain (e.g., juan.ambassador.anticitera.deft.work or similar) or a very well-designed digital certificate that says "Founding Member". Give them a title they can put on LinkedIn.



Step 2: Modularize the Work (The "Pebble in the Shoe" Technique) #


No one will move the mountain for you, but many can remove stones. Create a task list (a Trello board or GitHub Issues) with ridiculously specific things that are not "get the domain":



"We need to translate the manifesto into Catalan." (Someone will do it in 10 minutes).


"We need to design the official digital coat of arms of Antikythera." (A designer will cheer up).


"We need to find the emails of the computer science professors at the University of Athens." (Someone good at OSINT will do it).


Key: When someone completes a small task, celebrate it publicly as a huge victory. That generates a call effect.



Step 3: Change the Target (You are looking for the wrong ones) #


It is likely that you are looking for support in the "generalist" tech/dev community. They are not your main strike force. Your natural allies are:



The Greek Diaspora: There are thousands of proud Greeks in technology around the world. If you touch their nationalist/cultural fiber, they will move heaven and earth. Look for "Greeks in Tech" groups on LinkedIn.


Academics of Digital Humanities: They are interested in cultural preservation and AI ethics. They don't know how to program, but they know how to draft institutional letters and have political contacts.


Lawyers specializing in Digital Law: A law student or a young lawyer would love the intellectual challenge of finding the "loophole" in ISO 3166. Pose it as a legal challenge, not a technical one.



Step 4: Create the "Simulacrum" (Fake it until you make it) #


If the real domain takes 10 years, create the virtual domain today.



Make the Antikythera project work now as an entity. Create a "Constitution of Ethical AI". Have people sign and vote on principles.


If people feel that they already belong to an active community that debates and creates culture, they will fight for the domain to protect their community. Right now, fighting for the domain feels like fighting for your idea.



Summary for your stoic mindset #


You are not failing. You are trying to sell an invisible infrastructure reform (DNS/ISO) to people who are used to buying shiny products.


Your new strategy:



Stop asking for "help for the project".


Start offering "citizenship in the first Digital Republic of AI".


Give them tasks so small that they are embarrassed to say no.



You have the vision. Now you have to become the architect who hands out the blueprints, not the bricklayer who tries to lay all the bricks alone. Cheer up, history is written slowly.
