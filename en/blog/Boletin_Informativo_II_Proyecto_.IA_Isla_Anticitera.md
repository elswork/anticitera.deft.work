Project Updates #


These are the project news since the last newsletter in March.


What achievements can we highlight in this time? #



We have reached 100 signatures on the Change.org Petition.


We have tried to reach relevant personalities and companies, but so far we have not been successful, but we will not give up, we will try again by all available means.


We have created the Telegram channel Archimedes' Hacker Disciple to have a more direct connection with you.



Events and Activities #


It is worth highlighting the interview conducted with Pablo Gutierrez on the program De Hacker a Hacker.
